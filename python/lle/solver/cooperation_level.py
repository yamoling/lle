    """Precise classification of a world's cooperation requirement.

    *Cooperation* here means an agent of colour ``c`` blocks (shields) a laser
    of colour ``c`` so that a teammate can cross it. The dependency edge
    *helper → beneficiary* is recorded whenever the helper sits on its own
    beam while the beneficiary is somewhere downstream on that same beam.
    From the resulting dependency graph we read off the structural shape:

    Solvability gate:

    - ``UNSOLVABLE`` — no joint plan reaches all exits within ``t_max``.
    - ``INDEPENDENT`` — solvable under strict-laser semantics, so no agent ever
      has to block another. Cooperation is *not* required.

    Cooperative subtypes (cooperation required; ordered from most-structured
    to least-structured, matching the classifier's decision order):

    - ``FULLY_COUPLED`` — every agent belongs to a single strongly connected
      component in the dependency graph (everyone helps everyone, at least
      transitively). Requires at least two agents.
    - ``MUTUAL`` — at least one pair of agents help each other (the dependency
      graph contains a bidirectional edge ``a ↔ b``).
    - ``DISTRIBUTED`` — at least one beneficiary depends on two or more
      distinct helpers (indegree ≥ 2 in the dependency graph).
    - ``CHAIN`` — the dependency edges form a single linear chain
      ``a → b → c → …`` of length ≥ 2, with no branching or merging.
    - ``ASYMMETRIC`` — there is at least one helper → beneficiary edge but the
      structure is neither chain-like nor distributed (typically a single
      directed edge, never reciprocated).
    - ``COOPERATIVE`` — cooperation is required by the strict-laser test, yet
      no helper event was observed on the SAT-found plan (the catch-all when
      no other subtype applies).
